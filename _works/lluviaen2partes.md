"lluvia en la capital" was inspired by "la lluvia lenta" a poem by Gabriela Mistral. The piece reflects on the dual quality of rain, both its destructive and healing qualities. This duality is constantly experienced in the city of Santiago. A city that is in a region of intense draught and expanding desertification, that needs rain, but that suffers from deficient infrastructure, flooding the city with every rain.
