A combination of sound libraries, foley and synthesized sounds were used to re-create the aural experience of a pier recorded with a 360 camera. The original mix was made for 2nd Order AmbiX but youtube only supports 1st Order AmbiX. This work won the Facebook 360 challenge at University of Michigan in 2018.
