Together with a team of students at the University of Michigan we recreated the aural experience of a pier using 2nd order ambisonics. The sound design for the 360 video was made using sound libraries, foley techniques, and synthesized sounds. This project won the Facebook 360 challenge held at the University of Michigan in 2018.
