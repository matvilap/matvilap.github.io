Part of the "Stockhausen Serves the Worms" compilation, a collection of remixes of early electronic avant garde music released through Semibegun.

This is a tape piece that is inspired in Poème électronique and Edgard Varèse's approach to composition as ‘organized sound’. I produced a collection of sounds using three different synths (MiniMoog, Oberheim Matrix 12 and Arp Odyssey) in an attempt to explore their timbral range. The first half of the piece is the result of the curation and organization of this collection, using different tools to process and highlight the resemblances and contrasts between each of the sounds. The second half of the piece diverges from the idea of organized sound and moves closer to the idea of Zones of Intensities, also expressed by Varèse. Paraphrasing from "Liberation of Sound," he describes these zones as sound masses that move through different planes, differentiated by various timbres, colors and loudnesses, where the work can flow as rivers flow.
