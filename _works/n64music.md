First EP under the moniker milhous3 (the nickname I had in school). Feelings of nostalgia coalesce with fast breakbeats to re-live the thrill of being immersed in the virtual world, exploring the different narratives and mechanics that video games – such as Megaman 64, Metroid Prime, Final Fantasy X and Borderlands 2 – had to offer. The adrenaline rush I felt when engaging with these games has been recaptured in engaging with the dark hastiness of much Jungle/DnB music, which has been a strong influence and inspiration for this music.
