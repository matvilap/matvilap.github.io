Piece for carillon and electronics performed by Tiffany Ng at the Rockefeller Carillon New Music Festival in 2018. The scale of the carillon and the distance from which the audience attends the concert present the opportunity to create a sonic illusion for the audience. As the piece progresses, a loop of pre-recorded carillon samples is played back, increasing its speed on every repetition. Meanwhile the bells played by the performer are digitally processed. As the loop gets inhumanly fast, the illusion is revealed and what seemed to be played by the performer was the electronics and vice-versa.
