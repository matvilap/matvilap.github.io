*pedalGround* explores the interaction between electroacoustic instruments and the real time manipulation of a virtual environment. In a collaboration with electric guitarist Varun Kishore, the virtual environment becomes the playground where the virtual performer and the musician meet. The piece is centered around "rate of change". The virtual performer has control over different virtual objects where collision data is mapped to the on/off state of different guitar effects. A feedback loop between the performers emerges in the actions and reactions to the sonic and visual elements of the virtual environment.
