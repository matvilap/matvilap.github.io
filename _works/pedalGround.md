pedalGround explores the interaction between electroacoustic instruments and the real time manipulation of a virtual environment in a collaboration with Varun Kishore on electric guitar. The guitar pedalboard becomes the playground where the virtual environment and the electroacoustic performer meet by switching different guitar effects on and off. A feedback loop between the performers emerges in the actions and reactions to the sonic and visual elements of the piece.
