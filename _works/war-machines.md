Piece for piano, live processing, and live video montage. I adapted a midi controller to function as a live video editing tool to create montages in real time, and to control the live processing of audio input. The live montage acts also as a score for the pianist who improvises based on a composed motif. The juxtaposition of sound and image questions the relationship between high-end technological design and the ulterior destructive purpose of such technologies. Performed by Peeravich Panlerkitsakul (piano) and Matias Vilaplana (live electronics, live montage) at the University of Michigan.
