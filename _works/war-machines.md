Audiovisual piece for piano and live electronics. A midi controller was adapted to function as a live video editing tool to create montages in real time. The live montage acts as a score for the pianist. The piece poses the question, ‘can war machines be beautiful?’ through its juxtaposition of sound and image, reflecting on the high-end technological design and the destructive purpose of these machines.
Performed by Peeravich Panlerkitsakul (piano) and Matias Vilaplana (live electronics)
