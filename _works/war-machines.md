Piece for piano and live processing. A midi controller was adapted to function as a live video editing tool to create montages in real time. The pianist reacts to the changes in the video as the piece unfolds. The piece poses the question, 'can war machines be beautiful?' reflecting on the contrast between the high-end technological design and the destructive purpose of war machines.
