Unforeseen Collisions is a telematic VR performance developed in Unity 3D, using the Photon Realtime Engine to network the performers. In the piece, two performers build audiovisual patterns in an emergent causality system. It has been presented at the 2021 international symposium on Computer Music Multidisciplinary Research (CMMR) in Tokyo and Digitalis 2022 at the University of Virginia.
