Unforeseen Collisions is a networked VR performance developed in Unity 3D, using the Photon Unity Netowrking (PUN) to develop the shared environment for the performers. Two performers build audiovisual patterns in an emergent causality system. This performance has been presented at the 2021 international symposium on Computer Music Multidisciplinary Research (CMMR) in Tokyo and at the Digitalis Electronic Music Festival 2022 at the University of Virginia.
