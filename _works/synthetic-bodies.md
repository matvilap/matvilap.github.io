Synthetic Bodies is an interactive dance-music performance that uses motion capture technology to control real-time sound synthesis and audio manipulation. Developed as part of my Master's thesis at the University of Michigan, the goal of this project was to collaboratevily explore movement-based musical interactions through music composition and choreography. We explored different mappings between movement and sound using a Max/MSP library for the real-time analysis of motion descriptors. In weekly sessions, we tested different interaction models that combine the position, velocity, and acceleration, of different body parts of a dancer.
