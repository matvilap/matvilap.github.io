Synthetic Bodies is an interactive dance-music performance involving motion capture technology. The goal of this project was to build a performance system around giving control of the music to one dancer. In this project we explored different mappings based on body position on the stage, acceleration peaks of the performer's hands, and the distance between different body parts. Performed by Emily Van Duinen, sound and interaction design by Matias Vilaplana
