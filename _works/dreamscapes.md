Paisajes Oníricos / Dreamscapes for open instrumentation and virtual conductor. Performed by Popebama as part of the Composition and Computer Technologies ensemble in residence program at Old Cabell Hall, University of Virginia, February 2023

The piece reflects on the traditional representation of graphic scores as drawings on a two-dimensional plane. The piece expands on this notion by allocating the graphical elements in a 3D virtual environment. These elements acquire volume and mass, in addition to the incorporation of a spatio-temporal dimension that is controlled by a virtual conductor.
