Paisajes Oníricos / Dreamscapes (2023) for Saxophone and Percussion by Matias Vilaplana Stark
Performed by Popebama as part of the Composition and Computer Technologies ensemble in residence program at Old Cabell Hall, University of Virginia, February 2023

The performers 'read' the screen as a dynamic graphic score, musicaly transducing the 2D visuals that are in constant 'motion'. A third performer, navigates the 3D virtual environment, performing the 3D graphic score for the musicians.
