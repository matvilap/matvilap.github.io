Senderos is a piece that can be performed by any combination of instruments. It
can be performed as a solo piece or by an ensemble. The video score travels through 4 different digital landscapes. Musical parameters associated with each landscape are suggested to the performers as a way to interpret them as the video runs.

To remember, is to travel through our memories. These landscapes represent the
memories I have of those places, the people I traveled those places with and my
relationship to them. Memories are the echos of our own experiences, the digital landscapes are echos of the real place.
