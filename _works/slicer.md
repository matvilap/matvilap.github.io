Audiovisual algorithmic composition made using Max/MSP. The piece explores the musical and sonic possibilities of a custom-built sequencer/slicer using a single piano sample. Two compositions occur simultaneously: 1) sonically, a single element is fragmented and reorganized to create a larger structure; 2) visually, the static structure of a fictional city is sliced into smaller independent elements. The two mirror each other in a process of construction and deconstruction.
