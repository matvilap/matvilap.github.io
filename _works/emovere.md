Sample of one of the “sound objects” designed for Emovere, an interdisciplinary project on emotion, sound, and dance, led by Francisca Morand and Javier Jaimovich at Universidad de Chile. Different sound objects were composed by combining sound synthesis and manipulated vocal recordings from the performers. The dancers play the sound objects with their bio-signals throughout the choreography. Presented at GAM in Santiago, Chile, in 2014.
