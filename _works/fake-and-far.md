Program notes
"fake or far away is your number one source for information, conversation, relaxation, and value. We're bringing you the hot-button issues in a chilled-out setting, where you and a friend can determine what's really going on out there without killing the vibe. Experience the news hands-on, and determine how we all feel the old fashioned way––market sentiment. Discover the joys of communication, together, and determine what language you can and can't afford to keep. You'll get to the bottom of it – that's our guarantee!"

Made in collaboration with Becky Brown. Presented at the 2023 Stuttgart Filmwinter festival as part of the Expanded Media exhibition. It is a very literal experiment in the evolution of language through communal censorship, the news cycle, the financial system and the numbing effect of our online interactions.

It uses Vue 2, ojack's hydra-synth.js, Tone.js, and socket.io. The initial installation version used Max/MSP and Xebra.js for audio, but this changed for the web-only version.
