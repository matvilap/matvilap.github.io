Made in collaboration with Becky Brown and presented at the 2023 Stuttgart Filmwinter festival as part of the Expanded Media exhibition. It is a very literal experiment in the evolution of language through communal censorship, the news cycle, the financial system, and the numbing effect of our online interactions.

The sound design and video processing was made using different .js libraries, Tone.js and hydra-synth.js respectively.
