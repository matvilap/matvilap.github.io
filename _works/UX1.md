UX-1 is a video piece made by superimposing different recordings of movement-sound interactions with VR controllers. The piece was inspired by the long isolation periods undertook during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The hand-held controllers are mapped to different virtual instruments and sound effects in Ableton Live using a custom Max for Live device. The device can receive different controller parameters/input and map them to any parameter in other Ableton effect/instrument. Some the parameters sent from the controllers include XYZ position, euler rotation, velocity, acceleration and button/trigger input.
