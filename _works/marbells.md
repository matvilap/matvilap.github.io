Marbells is a musical causality system designed for the Oculus Rift S. In it the user can create diverse polyphonic and polyrhythmic structures by placing resonant blocks in the pathway of marbles. The resonant blocks produce sound when a marble comes in contact with them. The user can spawn as many blocks as they want, with a selection of four different types each with different timbral characteristics. The blocks are located at the center of the virtual space and are re-spawned as the user takes them from their corresponding pedestal. The blocks are not affected by physics and suspend in mid air when released. The user also has control of the tempo at which marbles spawn and the tuning of each block.
