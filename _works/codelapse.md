For this performance I made a Max/MSP patch to control the length of different loops. The patch is mapped to a MIDI controller, where up to eight loops can be controlled. It allows to control volume, pan, mute, pitch and the length of the samples used. The length can go from an audible range (where the sample can be identified), to an inaudible range where the sample turns into pitch material (since it is always looping). The video is made of multiple screen recordings layered on top of each other at different speeds. The screen recordings consist of multiple instances of live coding visuals in the Hydra environment.
