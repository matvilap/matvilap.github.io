Stereo version of an ambient piece for six speakers as part of the “Landmine Project” exhibition, in collaboration with Colectivo Agencia de Borde. The piece explores the mediation of an inaccesible landscape through field recordings, drones and synthesized sounds evocative of landmines. Presented at the Museum of Contemporary Art Quinta Normal in Santiago, Chile.
