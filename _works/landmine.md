Creation of a generative music piece for the "Landmine Project" exhibition by Border Agency. The generative algorithm was developed in Max/MSP for a six-speaker configuration, using the spatiality of the room and exploiting the acoustic characteristics of it. The patch endlessly shuffles, combines, and overlaps multiple sound files of in situ recordings, flying drones, and synthesized sounds. The sound design of the exhibition seeks to extend key concepts of the demining process, such as the idea of tension and instability which raises from the uncertainty caused by the nonstatic condition of mines, and the remoteness and inaccessibility of the demining process itself.  

Exhibitions presented at MAC Quinta Normal in November 2016, and MAC Valdivia in January 2017.
