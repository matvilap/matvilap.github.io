Matias Vilaplana Stark is a Chilean music technologist, composer, and improviser. He is currently a Ph.D. student in the Composition and Computer Technologies program at the University of Virginia. His research interests lie at the intersection of immersive media and musical practice, working on designing interactive music environments with virtual reality systems and the creation of 3D virtual environments as graphic scores for musical improvisation. He holds a Bachelor’s in Fine Arts from the Music Technology program at Universidad de Chile, and a Master’s in Media Arts from the University of Michigan. In Santiago, he worked as a recording engineer and sound designer, collaborating with the artistic fields of dance, theater and visual arts in various projects. At Michigan, he focused on creating movement-based interactive musical systems using motion capture technology. He also started the  improvisation group Lines, performing live electronics with a rotating ensemble.

He is currently working on software tools to prototype movement-based interactions between DAWs and VR systems.
