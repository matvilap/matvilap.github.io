I am a music technologist, composer, improviser, and educator from Chile.  My research interests lie at the intersection of immersive media and musical practice. In my work, I design interactive systems for musical performance with virtual reality, compose multi-channel tape pieces for immersive sound systems, and improvise electronic music with custom digital/analog configurations. My work has been presented in festivals and conferences such as SEAMUS, NIME, the SF Tape Music Festival, Cube Fest, CAMPGround and the Performing Media Festival. In my career, I have also worked as a recording engineer and sound designer, having collaborated on various multi-disciplinary projects involving dance, theater, and visual arts.
