I am a music technologist, composer, improviser, and educator from Chile.  My research interests lie at the intersection of immersive media and musical practice. In my work, I design interactive systems for musical performance with virtual reality, compose multi-channel tape pieces for immersive sound systems, and improvise electronic music with custom digital/analog configurations. My work has been presented in festivals and conferences such as SEAMUS, NIME, the SF Tape Music Festival, Cube Fest, CAMPGround and the Performing Media Festival, and I have written pieces for different ensembles including Ensemble Dal Niente, Tokyo Gen'On Project, Popebama, and Hypercube. I worked as a recording and mixing engineer at Estudios Agartha in Santiago, Chile, where I also collaborated as a sound designer on various multi-disciplinary projects involving dance, theater, and visual arts.
