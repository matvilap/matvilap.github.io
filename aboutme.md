My creative practices involve recording/mixing, music composition, music interaction design in virtual reality and improvisation with live audio processing, among other things. My current research focuses in music interaction design in virtual environments employing consumer grade HMDs and Motion Capture technology through practice-based methods.

I hold a Bachelor of Fine Arts with distinction in Music Technology from Universidad de Chile in Santiago, Chile, as well as an M.A. in Media Arts from University of Michigan. I'm currently a PhD candidate in the Composition and Computer Technologies program at University of Virginia.

I did something!!!!!!
