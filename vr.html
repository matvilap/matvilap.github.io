               <p class="pieces">Marbells is a musical causality system designed for the Oculus Rift S. In it the user can create diverse polyphonic and polyrhythmic structures by placing resonant blocks in the pathway of marbles. The resonant blocks produce sound when a marble comes in contact with them. The user can spawn as many blocks as they want, with a selection of four different types each with different timbral characteristics. The blocks are located at the center of the virtual space and are re-spawned as the user takes them from their corresponding pedestal. The blocks are not affected by physics and suspend in mid air when released. The user also has control of the tempo at which marbles spawn and the tuning of each block.</p>

               <p class="pieces">The Ball Pit is a stochastic musical system designed for the HTC Vive as a musical interface at the scale of an environment. The user is situated in an enclosed space with tiled walls where they can move around physically in room scale. Using the controller the user can spawn, grab, strike and destroy balls in the virtual space. Once thrown into the room, the balls move and bounce of the tiles without being affected by gravity. When a wall tile is struck by a ball, it lights up in red and emits a sound reminiscent of the bouncing of a ping-pong ball. Each tile displays a different shade of green and is tuned to a unique pitch from the chromatic scale. While the pitch of the sound is based on the tuning of a tile, its octave is determined by the size of the ball (3 sizes, smaller balls produce higher-octave sounds).</p>
